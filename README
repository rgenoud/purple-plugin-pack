The Purple Plugin Pack was originally created by Gary Kramlich and Stu
Tomlinson as a way to distribute their ever growing lists of simple Pidgin
plugins. It has since grown from its origins of about 6 plugins to over 50.

Also, many more developers have continued to add to it, including John Bailey,
Peter Lawler, Sadrul Habib Chowdhury, Richard Laager, and Paul Aurich.  It has
also become a place to save plugins whose authors have since abandoned them.

rgenoud:
I've imported this plugin pack from debian jessie source package :
https://packages.debian.org/sid/pidgin-plugin-pack

I've just modified the ignore plugin so that it can ignore only join/parts from
specific users.
(Some users are "unstable" and keep parting/joining from chatrooms. It seems to be
a network problem (or a windows problem?))
That's the reason this was made.

Build instructions: (just for the ignore plugin)
apt-get install pidgin-dev libpurple-dev
In the purple plugin pack directory:
./configure
make -j $(nproc) && mkdir -p $HOME/.purple/plugins/ && cp ignore/.libs/ignore.so $HOME/.purple/plugins/

Help:
/help ignore
ignore [-c|-j] [+<ignore> -<unignore>]
Examples:
   'ignore +StupidBot -NotABot'		 - (in a chat) Starts ignoring StupidBot, and removes NotABot from ignore list.
   'ignore -c +AnotherBot'	 - (in a chat) Starts ignoring AnotherBot, but only in chats.
   'ignore -j +AnotherBot'	 - Starts ignoring join/part messages from AnotherBot.
   'ignore +'	 - (in an IM) Starts ignoring this person.
   'ignore -'	 - (in an IM) Starts unignoring this person.
   'ignore'	 - Lists the current ignore rules.
